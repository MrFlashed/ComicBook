# Introduction
Following an angular tutorial because of school(We didn't have to follow the tutorial. You could have made your own project)<br>
I've done all 6 parts of the tutorial which we had to do.

## Week 1 
The first week we did 1. The hero editor.
In this tutorial we started with generating a component with "ng generate component heroes" after this I had to create a hero interface and display said hero interface. I imported some modules. Made it so we could show the hero object.
## Week 2
The second week we did 2. Display a list.
I created a new file in which I could create some heroes I could display in a list. I added a click event which I binded and I added a event handler. The tutorial added styling but the styling wasn't the same as mine. Mine looked a bit weird.
## Week 3
The third week we did 3. Create a feature component.
## Week 4
The fourth week we did a part of 4. Add services.
## Week 5
The fifth week we had to follow the tutorial at https://angular.io/tutorial so that's what I did. I finished the 4th part of the tutorial.
## Week 6
The sixth week I finished the fith and sixth part of the tutorial.
